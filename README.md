# CO2 Emissions in 2023
This web mapping application was built using Leaflet.js and Chart.js, along with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, to visualize CO₂ emissions across different countries in 2023. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, then cleaned and processed using Python.

In the map, the size of the circles represents the amount of CO₂ emissions in tons—larger circles indicate higher emissions, while smaller circles represent lower emissions. Additionally, the chart displays the total CO₂ emissions from six continents.
